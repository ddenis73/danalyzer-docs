# Data browsing

**Before you can interact with the GUI, you must click in an empty gray area of the GUI**.

Navigate between epochs by pressing the left or right arrow key (or by pressing the < or > buttons). You can jump forwards or backwards in chunks of 10 epochs by clicking the >> or << buttons. The current epoch number is displayed in the bottom left. You can type any epoch number into this box to immediately jump to it. You can also move to a specific epoch by clicking on the corresponding space in the hypnogram window at the top of the GUI.

The current scale of the data is indicated in the box next to the montage list (default is 150). The scale can be adjusted by typing a new scale value into the box, or using the +/- buttons to increase or decrease the scale in chunks of 25.

!!!tip
	Scale units in danalyzer are essentially aribtary. danalyzer assumes the data are stored in microvolts, but this may not always be the case. If your data are all flat lines, one reason could be that the data are not microvolts.
