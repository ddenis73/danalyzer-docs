# Sleep scoring

Sleep scoring is incredibly straightforward. Score an epoch simply by pressing the corresponding button on the keyboard:

0 = Wake 1 = N1 2 = N2 3 = N3 4 = N4 5 = REM 6 = Movement

After scoring an epoch, the display will automatically advance. If you wish to unstage an epoch, press the period (.) key. As you score, you will see that the hypnogram also starts to be created. If you want to make any notes about the record that you are scoring, press the n key to bring up the Notes window. Here you can record any details about the record, and these notes will be saved alongside the score file.
