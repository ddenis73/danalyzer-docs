# Data browsing and sleep scoring

**Before you can interact with the GUI, you must click in any empty gray area of the GUI.**

Navigate between epochs by pressing the left or right arrow key. You can jump forwards or backwards in chunks of 10 epochs by clicking the >> or << buttons respectively. The current epoch number is displayed in the bottom left. You can type any epoch number into this box to immediately jump to it. You can also move to a specific epoch by clicking on the corresponding space in the hypnogram window at the top of the GUI.

The current scale of the data is indicated in the box next to the montage list (default is 150). The scale can be adjusted by typing a new scale value into the box, or use the +/- buttons to increase or decrease the scale in chunks of 25. 

Sleep scoring is incredibly straightforward in sleepDanalyzer. Score an epoch simply by pressing the corresponding button on the keyboard:

0 = Wake
1 = N1
2 = N2
3 = N3
4 = N4
5 = REM
6 = Movement

After scoring an epoch, the display will automatically advance. If you wish to unstage an epoch, press the period key. As you score, you will see that the hypnogram also starts to be created. If you want to make any notes about the record that you are scoring, press the n key to bring up the Notes window. Here you can record any details about the record, and these notes will be saved alongside the score file.
